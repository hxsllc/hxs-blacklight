  <h2>ABOUT DS2.0</h2>

  <p>Digital Scriptorium (DS) is a growing consortium of American institutions with collections of global, premodern manuscripts. As an online union catalog, DS unites scattered rare materials, including dispersed manuscript leaves from dismembered books, into a national digital platform for cross-collection teaching and scholarly research. 
  </p>
  <p>
DS records not only include recognized touchstone materials, such as manuscripts signed and dated by their scribes or illuminators, but also unidentified manuscripts that are traditionally unlikely candidates for exhibition or reproduction in print. DS enables free and open discovery of information about historically significant but often understudied manuscript materials.
